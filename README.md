I work as a machine learning engineer. I have broad-ranging interests, but in machine learning they include [Recsys](https://vickiboykis.com/2021/10/28/recsys-2021-recap/) and [search](https://boringml.com/docs/recsys/minhash/), [MLOps and production](https://vickiboykis.com/2020/06/09/getting-machine-learning-to-production/), engineering best practices, distributed systems, and type safety. I write a site called [boringml.](https://boringml.com/) I recently wrote a [terrible static site generator in Java.](https://github.com/veekaybee/caffeine) I like [reverse-engineering neural nets.](https://gist.github.com/veekaybee/6f8885e9906aa9c5408ebe5c7e870698) and [machine learning systems.](https://vicki.substack.com/p/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about) 

My current side project is [Viberary, which recommends you books based on vibe.](https://vickiboykis.com/2022/12/05/the-cloudy-layers-of-modern-day-programming/)

My preferred languages are: Python, Java, SQL, and if I have to, Scala and PHP. 

I once ran an ML/data conference called [Normconf.](https://normconf.com/)
