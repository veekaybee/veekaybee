I work as a machine learning engineer. I have broad-ranging interests, but in machine learning they include Recsys and Search, MLOps, engineering best practices, distributed systems, and type safety. I recently wrote a [terrible static site generator in Java.](https://github.com/veekaybee/caffeine)

My current side project is [Viberary, which recommends you books based on vibe.](https://vickiboykis.com/2022/12/05/the-cloudy-layers-of-modern-day-programming/)

I once ran an ML/data conference called [Normconf.](https://normconf.com/)
