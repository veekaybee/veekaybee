### Hi, I'm Vicki! ðŸ‘‹
I work as a machine learning engineer. I have broad-ranging interests. In machine learning they include [Recsys](https://vickiboykis.com/2021/10/28/recsys-2021-recap/) and [search](https://boringml.com/docs/recsys/minhash/), [MLOps and production](https://vickiboykis.com/2020/06/09/getting-machine-learning-to-production/), and distributed systems. I like [reverse-engineering neural nets](https://gist.github.com/veekaybee/6f8885e9906aa9c5408ebe5c7e870698) and [machine learning systems.](https://vicki.substack.com/p/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about) 

My side project is [Viberary, which recommends you books based on vibe.](https://vickiboykis.com/2022/12/05/the-cloudy-layers-of-modern-day-programming/)

I wrote a paper about [what embeddings are.](https://vickiboykis.com/what_are_embeddings/). 

I take notes on what I learn [here.](http://vickiboykis.com/ml-garden/) 

I once ran an ML/data conference called [Normconf.](https://normconf.com/)
